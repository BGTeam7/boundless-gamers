            <p className="mx-4 md:mx-24">Boundless Gamers started out as simply a weekly podcast. As we grew, we found the opportunity to expand our reach and help more people. We became a non-profit charitable organization that promotes our love of gaming matched with our need to help others. We give away Community donated Steam games to those who are having a bad day, are experiencing hardship or need to escape for a short time while in the hospital. Our wonderful Community donates so generously that we are able to also conduct free game giveaways weekly on our various social media platforms as well as on our weekly podcast show. </p>
            <p className="mx-4 md:mx-24">We started working with other charitable organizations that share our goals and found other avenues where we can help even more people the ever before. We partnered with and started a new game development studio with the sole purpose to create exciting fun games where the proceeds to our charity partners. Pixel Games Studio was born as a division of Boundless Gamers. We share common goals and missions, but going about them differently. Boundless Gamers still focuses on giving away free games to those in need, raising funds for charity and providing social media content. Pixel Games Studio has taken the path of creating games by bringing the development community together to create excellence, helping and boosting the game development industry while staying true to itâ€™s non-profit charitable origins.</p>
